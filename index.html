    <h2>FUN FACT:</h2>

        <li>HTML is the blue print of all websites?</li>
        <li>If the website doesn't boot up properly the user will see mainly the basic texts or layouts</li>
        <li>HTML is pared with CSS which helps add flare to the webpage basically adding some touch up</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>This will be section one for random words</h3>
    <p2>How does a referendum swing the terminal gate? How will the cap develop the parody? </br>Does the flute punt against the appalled crisp?

    <h4>This will display the various different sections that will be color coded to show the effects of CSS</h4>
    <p3>The null diner stumbles behind a behavior. Behind the mistake shies away the bass.</br>

        The paranoia weights the stomach under the wiring breakdown.</p3>
